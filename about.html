            <p>
                The Regional Centre for Geodesy (RCG) at IIT Bombay, established in 2022, is a  hub dedicated to advancing applied geodesy. Focused on strengthening geospatial capabilities in the western region of India, RCG trains professionals and students in state-of-the-art technologies such as GNSS, UAVs, space-based geodesy, and imaging geodesy. These tools are applied to critical areas such as monitoring mass changes, surface deformation analysis and studying cryospheric processes, enabling accurate and real-time data collection and interpretation.
            </p>
            <p>
                RCG adopts a multidisciplinary and application-driven approach, integrating expertise from civil engineering, earth sciences, and geoinformatics to address complex geophysical challenges. The centre develops new algorithms and tools for processing large geospatial datasets, and promotes field-based practices that translate academic knowledge into practical solutions. This fusion of geodetic science with real-world applications positions RCG at the forefront of innovation in precision surveying and geophysical modeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond research, RCG is actively involved in capacity building and outreach. Through workshops, short courses, and training programs, it empowers professionals, researchers, and students to apply advanced geodetic techniques in their fields. Its broader mission is to support national priorities in disaster management, resource planning, and sustainable development, playing a key role in enhancing India’s geospatial infrastructure and contributing to long-term resilience.

                    The National Centre for Geodesy (NCG) was established to address the lack of specialized education and expertise in Geodesy in India. While related fields like Surveying, Geoinformatics, and GIS are taught at some institutions, fundamental and advanced Geodesy remains significantly underrepresented. Supported by the Department of Science and Technology, NCG aims to become a national and international hub of excellence in Geodesy through high-quality postgraduate education, interdisciplinary research, and strategic global collaboration. </p>
                <p> As part of this national network, RCG IIT Bombay plays a key role in advancing GNSS, remote sensing, and satellite geodesy through specialized training, academic resource development, and cutting-edge research. The network connects NCG IITK with institutions—including IIT Bombay, ISRO SAC, IIT Roorkee, Anna University and others—collaborating to build geodetic capacity and support real-world applications across the country.</p>
