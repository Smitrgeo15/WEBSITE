                    The Regional Centre for Geodesy (RCG) at IIT Bombay was established in 2022 as a hub for advancing applied geodesy. 
                    It is part of a national network led by the <a href = "https://www.iitk.ac.in/ncg/"> National Centre for Geodesy (NCG)</a> at IIT Kanpur. 
                    The primary objective of the NCG is to nucleate and strengthen activities in the area of Geodesy education, capacity building, and academic research and development. 
                    This initiative is supported by the Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology. 
                    The NCG was initially conceived due to limited education in Geodesy at the national level. 
                    Although some universities offer courses on Surveying and Mapping, Geoinformatics, and GIS, they do not delve into the fundamentals and advanced concepts of Geodesy. 
                    There is a recognized need for training human resources in these aligned areas to address the limited national expertise in fields like Geodesy and SAR interferometry.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">    
                    The RCG focuses on enhancing geospatial capabilities in the western region of India. 
                    It trains students and professionals using state-of-the-art technologies such as GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), space-based geodesy, and imaging geodesy. 
                    These tools are applied to critical areas like monitoring mass changes, analyzing surface deformation, and studying cryospheric processes.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
                    RCG adopts a multidisciplinary approach, integrating expertise from civil engineering, earth sciences, and geoinformatics to tackle complex geophysical challenges. 
                    The center develops new algorithms and tools for processing large geospatial datasets and promotes field-based practices that translate academic knowledge into practical solutions. 
                    Beyond research, RCG is actively involved in capacity building through workshops, short courses, and training programs to empower individuals to apply advanced geodetic techniques in their respective fields. 
                    Its broader mission is to support national priorities such as disaster management, resource planning, and sustainable development, playing a key role in enhancing India’s geospatial infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
                    As part of this national network, RCG IIT Bombay plays a key role in advancing GNSS, remote sensing, and satellite geodesy through specialized training, 
                    academic resource development, and cutting-edge research. The network connects NCG IITK with institutions—including IIT Bombay, ISRO SAC, IIT Roorkee, 
                    Anna Univer sity and others—collaborating to build geodetic capacity and support real-world applications across the country
